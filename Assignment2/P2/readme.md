Finding execution time of program: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5248915/execution-time-of-c-program
Discussed with Austin Lee and Rhett Devlin how to approach the problem.

So I wasn't able to finish this part of the assignment but I do feel that I
understand many of the take-aways it is meant to provide. My code finds the
minimum SAR of the 18 Consumer Price Index, as explained in the first task of
the assignment PDF but does not get to the second part.

In lieu of Part 2, I did my own testing with the MapReduce code to see how
differing numbers of threads effected program run times and it is these results
which are presented in the PDF. I know I was supposed to implement the threads,
but I wasn't able to and still want to show I have understood how varying numbers
of threads effect runtime.
