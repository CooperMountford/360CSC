Do we switch back to main_context after each task or can we go straight from one task
   to another? How?

What is sleep_ms() used for? If we use it, all other tasks are blocked so why
   wouldnt we just use the wake time calculated with time_ms()?

What does the task_wait() hint mean? If we just need to check if handle =
   current_task, why wouldn't we just do that within task_wait() and not have to
   call scheduler()?
