Doubly Linked List ReadMe:
I think this is the third time I've had to write a DLL in C but this time gave
   me the most frustrations by far. It took me so long to figure out what was
   going on, that I didn't leave enough time for the shell.
I would have liked to do the extra methods but didn't get the time.

Shell ReadMe:
The bulk of the code was sourced from Stephen Brennan's tutorial on writing a
   shell in C. I followed along with the tutorial, copying the important bits
   and changing the notes and variables/whitespaces of key sections to match
   how I write C code (AKA, camelCase. Not sure if that's "proper" though)
Info on how to do PWD is from https://linux.die.net/man/3/getcwd
I also used general ideas from https://indradhanush.github.io/blog/writing-a-unix-shell-part-1/
I learned how to make a makefile here https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/howto_makefiles.html

Known "Features":
Sometimes the ? doesn't show up after you do type in a command the shell doesn't
   understand
Control+D doesnt exit the program. I understand the idea of how to do it, as shown
   in the commented out code of my attempting it, but I couldn't get it right
You can't view the list of env vars because I ran out of time, its 9pm, and I haven't
   eaten today so I can't work on this any more...




I should have given myself more time.
