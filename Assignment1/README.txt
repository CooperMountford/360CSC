Doubly Linked List ReadMe:
I think this is the third time I've had to write a DLL in C but this time gave
   me the most frustrations by far. It took me so long to figure out what was
   going on, that I didn't leave enough time for the shell.
I would have liked to do the extra methods but didn't get the time.

Shell ReadMe:

The bulk of the code was sourced from Stephen Brennan's tutorial on writing a
   shell in C. I followed along with the tutorial, copying the important bits
   and changing the notes and variables/whitespaces of the sections I understood
   to match how I write C code (AKA, camelCase. Not sure if that's "proper" though)
